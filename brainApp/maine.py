[""" A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. 
The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. 
How much does the ball cost? _____ cents""",
"5",

 '''Say the ball costs X. Then the bat costs $1 more, 
so it is X + 1. So we have bat + ball = X + (X + 1) = 1.1 
because together they cost $1.10. This means 2X + 1 = 1.1, 
then 2X = 0.1, so X = 0.05. This means the ball costs 5 
cents and the bat costs $1.05.'''

''' If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets,
 then it takes 1 machine 
5 minutes to make 1 widget 
(each machine is making a widget in 5 minutes). 
If we have 100 machines working together, 
then each can make a widget in 5 minutes. 
So there will be 100 widgets in 5 minutes.'''],
